    <p>
      This page exists to clarify the boundaries of XPGuess in plain language.
      The goal is to prevent confusion by stating what the platform is designed to do,
      what it is not designed to do, and how XP functions inside the system.
    </p>

    <h2>What XPGuess Is</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess is an educational sports learning platform that uses simple Yes / No questions
      to teach how real-world professional sports systems work across multiple disciplines.
    </p>

    <p>
      Questions are resolved using verified outcomes based on official sources, rules,
      or governing body announcements — not rumor, speculation, or unofficial reporting.
    </p>

    <p>
      XPGuess is designed to support governance-first learning, documentation,
      and decision discipline — especially in environments where timing, eligibility,
      and system rules affect athlete outcomes.
    </p>

    <h2>What XPGuess Is Not</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Not gambling or betting:</strong> no wagering, no odds markets, no payouts.</li>
      <li><strong>Not a financial product:</strong> XP is not money, not redeemable, and not an investment.</li>
      <li><strong>Not a sportsbook:</strong> outcomes are educational and based on verified resolution rules.</li>
      <li><strong>Not an agent or broker:</strong> the platform does not negotiate contracts or represent talent.</li>
      <li><strong>Not a promise engine:</strong> the system does not guarantee selection, scholarships, or professional outcomes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What XP Represents</h2>

    <p>
      XP (Experience Points) is a participation and learning metric used to track:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Engagement with educational content</li>
      <li>Consistency and decision discipline</li>
      <li>Verified participation in structured workflows</li>
      <li>Progress over time (not a single outcome)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      XP does <strong>not</strong> represent cash value, does <strong>not</strong> convert to currency,
      and does <strong>not</strong> function as a financial instrument.
    </p>

    <h2>Why These Boundaries Matter</h2>

    <p>
      Sports systems are often affected by timing pressure, incomplete records,
      subjective narratives, and unequal access to guidance.
      XPGuess is designed to help people learn the system rules
      and document disciplined engagement in a structured way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Clear boundaries protect users, partners, and organizations by ensuring the platform remains
      educational, governed, and standards-based.
