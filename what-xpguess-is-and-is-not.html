    <h1>What XPGuess Is — and Is Not</h1>

    <p>
      XPGuess is an educational platform designed to help people learn and measure
      decision-making through structured, hypothetical scenarios.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page exists to clearly define the scope, safeguards, and intended use of XPGuess
      for users, families, investors, platforms, and reviewers.
    </p>

    <h2>Plain-Language Purpose</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess helps users understand how decisions work in complex systems—such as professional sports,
      governance, and timing-based outcomes—without involving real money or financial risk.
    </p>

    <p>
      All scenarios on XPGuess are hypothetical and designed for learning purposes only.
    </p>

    <h2>What XPGuess Does</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess provides a structured environment where users:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Answer clear Yes / No questions based on real-world decision frameworks</li>
      <li>Review outcomes using verified, public information</li>
      <li>Track learning progress using XP (Experience Points)</li>
      <li>Analyze patterns and decision quality over time</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      AI may be used to analyze participation patterns and generate educational insights,
      but it does not act on a user’s behalf or execute decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>What XPGuess Explicitly Does Not Do</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess does <strong>not</strong>:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Accept deposits or hold user funds</li>
      <li>Execute trades, wagers, or transactions</li>
      <li>Promise or imply financial returns</li>
      <li>Generate income for users</li>
      <li>Operate as a trading bot or automated investment system</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      XP (Experience Points) are not money, not a currency, and not redeemable for cash.
    </p>

    <h2>Educational & Compliance Positioning</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess operates in the same category as educational simulators, analytics tools,
      and decision-training platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is not:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>A broker</li>
      <li>An exchange</li>
      <li>A custodian</li>
      <li>A financial advisor</li>
      <li>A financial product</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The platform is intentionally designed to remain non-custodial,
      non-financial, and education-first.
    </p>

    <h2>Adult Use & Future Versions</h2>

    <p>
      Future versions of XPGuess for adult users may introduce more advanced analytics,
      deeper scenario complexity, and expanded educational tooling.
    </p>

    <p>
      These versions will maintain the same foundational safeguards:
      no custody, no execution, no financial incentives, and no automated transactions.
    </p>

    <h2>Why These Boundaries Matter</h2>

    <p>
      Clear boundaries protect users, families, investors, and the platform itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      By defining scope intentionally, XPGuess can scale responsibly across education,
      sports, and decision science—without exposing users to financial risk
      or regulatory confusion.
    </p>

    <h2>Compliance Notice</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess is an educational platform. It does not involve money, wagering,
      prizes, equity, or financial outcomes.
      XP is used solely to track learning progress and decision understanding.
