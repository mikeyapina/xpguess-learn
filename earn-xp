      <strong>Educational, Not Gambling</strong>
      XPGuess is an educational platform. It does not involve money, wagering, prizes, equity, or financial outcomes.
      XP is used only to track learning progress, participation, and verified activity inside the system.
    </div>

    <h2 id="what-this-page-explains">What This Page Explains</h2>
    <p>
      This page explains <strong>how XP is earned in XPGuess</strong> using a transparent progress framework that makes it easy to understand
      what actions earn XP and what XP represents.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      XPGuess uses progress-style clarity similar to how other platforms present “ways to earn” and “status tiers,”
      but XPGuess does not offer investment credits, cash, carry, or financial rewards.
    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2 id="what-is-xp">What Is XP in XPGuess?</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>XP (Experience Points)</strong> are a <strong>learning metric</strong>.
      They represent participation and progress in understanding how professional football (soccer) decisions work —
      especially transfers, governance, and official outcomes.
    </p>

    <div class="pillrow" aria-label="XP definitions">
      <span class="pill">Educational progress</span>
      <span class="pill">Participation-based</span>
      <span class="pill">Non-cash</span>
      <span class="pill">Not redeemable</span>
      <span class="pill">Verified-topic learning</span>
    </div>

    <div class="callout">
      <strong>Important</strong>
      XP is <strong>not money</strong>, not a currency, and not redeemable for cash. It is comparable to progress points in a training or learning program.

    <h2 id="ways-to-earn">Ways to Earn XP</h2>

    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>1) Answering Verified Yes / No Questions</h3>
        <p>
          XPGuess uses simple <strong>Yes / No questions</strong> to teach how real decisions in professional football resolve.
          Questions are designed around verified events and official outcomes — not rumor.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Questions are based on real-world football decision points.</li>
          <li>Resolutions reference official announcements (clubs, leagues, governing bodies).</li>
          <li>XP is awarded for participation and completion as part of learning progression.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>2) Completing Learning Modules (when available)</h3>
        <p>
          Some XP is earned through structured educational content that explains how the system works.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Decision-making walkthroughs</li>
          <li>Transfer-market explainers</li>
          <li>Governance concepts (rules, compliance, official sources)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>3) Busking XP Conversion (Verified Social Activity)</h3>
        <p>
          XPGuess includes an optional pathway called <strong>Busking</strong>, designed for people who build real-world momentum through performance
          and social platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Busking mode, the system can <strong>convert verified platform signals</strong> (for example: engagement activity, followers, or verified reach)
          into <strong>XP for learning progression and system participation</strong>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>This conversion is designed to mirror how social platforms recognize activity in their own ecosystems.</li>
          <li>XPGuess uses it as a <strong>non-cash educational credit</strong> to represent verified momentum and consistency.</li>
          <li>No cash, no payout promises, and no investment credits are provided by XPGuess for Busking XP.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout">
          <strong>Where to Learn More</strong>
          Busking has its own section inside the platform. Visit:

          <div class="muted" style="margin-top:8px;">

    <h2 id="xp-status">XP Status Levels (Learning Progress Only)</h2>
    <p>
      XPGuess may display <strong>status tiers</strong> to help learners understand progress — similar to levels in training platforms.
      These tiers are <strong>not financial</strong> and do not provide monetary rewards.
    </p>

    <div class="kpi" aria-label="Example progress tiers">
      <div class="box">
        <div class="label">Status tier</div>

      <div class="box">
        <div class="label">Status tier</div>
        <div class="value">Active Learner</div>
        <div class="muted">Consistent participation</div>
      </div>
      <div class="box">

        <div class="value">Expert Track</div>
        <div class="muted">Educational mastery path</div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="muted">
      Tier names and thresholds may evolve over time, but their purpose remains the same: <strong>educational progress tracking</strong>.

    <h2 id="what-xp-is-not">What XP Does Not Do</h2>
    <div class="card doNot">

    <h2 id="why-xp-exists">Why XPGuess Uses XP</h2>
    <p>
      XP exists to solve a real educational gap: many people interact with sports outcomes without understanding how decisions are actually made.
      XP helps learners track progress without introducing monetization pressure.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Encourages structured learning and consistency</li>
      <li>Tracks engagement over time</li>
      <li>Supports youth-safe, education-first participation</li>
      <li>Creates transparent milestones for coaches, parents, and learners</li>
