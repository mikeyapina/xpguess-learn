    <p>
      The XPGuess Learn pages explain how the platform works in plain language. This page describes the
      <strong>Fitness, Wellness, and Support Model</strong>—the training-first framework used to document participation,
      discipline, and readiness across sports and performance paths.
    </p>

    <h2>System Role and Purpose</h2>

    <p>
      The NTG platform, including XPGuess, operates as a <strong>training-first athlete development system</strong>
      designed to document participation, consistency, and readiness across sports and performance disciplines.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Fitness, Wellness, and Support Model exists to address a structural gap in modern sports systems:
      the lack of reliable, non-medical signals that connect <strong>training behavior</strong>, <strong>wellness engagement</strong>,
      and <strong>long-term development</strong> to talent evaluation and support decisions.
    </p>

    <p>
      This model is intentionally designed to support athletes, families, coaches, agents, sponsors, and organizations
      by providing <strong>objective, auditable development records</strong>, while deliberately avoiding medical diagnosis,
      treatment, or clinical assessment.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Layer Exists in the Platform</h2>

    <p>
      Many platforms separate critical components into disconnected systems: performance tracking without wellness context,
      financial support without development evidence, and talent evaluation without behavioral history.
    </p>

    <p>
      This fragmentation increases risk and reduces fairness. Common outcomes include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Mispriced talent</li>
      <li>Burnout and attrition</li>
      <li>Exploitation risk</li>
      <li>Unstable sponsorship and investment outcomes</li>
      <li>Increased legal and reputational exposure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The XPGuess Fitness Model closes this gap by creating a governed, non-medical development layer that connects
      training participation, engagement, and discipline to broader evaluation and support decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>What the Fitness and Support Model Includes</h2>

    <p>
      The Fitness and Support Model is composed of <strong>modular, non-medical tools</strong> that document engagement
      and structure rather than health outcomes. Modules can include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Structured training plans and routines</li>
      <li>Discrete fitness or skill components (“cards”) used to assemble sessions</li>
      <li>Daily activity and effort logging</li>
      <li>Nutrition education and self-reported adherence (non-clinical)</li>
      <li>Recovery and rehabilitation-style routines focused on participation, not diagnosis</li>
      <li>A structured support layer (“Therapy Mode”) centered on reflection and escalation, not treatment</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These components function as <strong>training and wellness documentation tools</strong>, not healthcare services.
    </p>

    <h2>What XP Represents in This Context</h2>

    <p>
      Within the Fitness Model, XP functions as a <strong>behavioral and participation ledger</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>XP may be awarded for:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Completing scheduled training sessions</li>
      <li>Maintaining consistency over time</li>
      <li>Engaging with educational content</li>
      <li>Logging effort, recovery, and adherence</li>
      <li>Participating in structured support workflows</li>
    </ul>

    <p>XP does <strong>not</strong> represent:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Medical improvement</li>
      <li>Mental health outcomes</li>
      <li>Injury diagnosis or recovery status</li>
      <li>Treatment effectiveness</li>
      <li>Clinical evaluation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      XP serves as a <strong>standardized, sport-agnostic signal of discipline, reliability, and development</strong>,
      enabling consistent evaluation across programs, sports, and jurisdictions.
    </p>

    <h2>Relationship to Medical Care and Telehealth</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess and NTG are <strong>not medical or telehealth providers</strong>.
      The platform is designed to coexist safely with external healthcare ecosystems through strict separation:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>XPGuess records participation and engagement only</li>
      <li>Licensed medical or psychological care occurs outside the platform</li>
      <li>No protected health information (PHI) is stored in XP or fitness logs</li>
      <li>Escalation events are logged without clinical detail</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Support and “Therapy Mode” — Defined Scope</h2>

    <p>
      “Therapy Mode” within NTG is a <strong>structured support and reflection layer</strong>, not clinical therapy.
      It may include guided check-ins, self-reflection prompts, well-being awareness tools, and escalation signals
      to guardians, agents, or external professionals.
    </p>

    <p>
      When escalation occurs:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The system records that support was requested or recommended</li>
      <li>Clinical conversations and records remain off-platform</li>
      <li>No diagnosis or treatment data enters the XP system</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How This Supports Evaluation and Responsible Decisions</h2>

    <p>
      For coaches, agents, scouts, sponsors, and organizations, the Fitness Model provides objective, non-medical
      development indicators such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Training consistency over time</li>
      <li>Load and recovery engagement patterns</li>
      <li>Behavioral fatigue and diseng
