    <h1 style="margin-top:0;">Fitness, Wellness & Support Framework</h1>

    <p>
      XPGuess includes a training-first fitness, wellness, and support framework designed to document
      athlete participation, consistency, and readiness across sports and performance pathways.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system is intentionally non-medical. It does not diagnose conditions, provide treatment,
      or store clinical health data. Its purpose is to support structured development, reflection,
      and governance in athletic environments.
    </p>

    <h2>System Purpose</h2>

    <p>
      The fitness and support framework exists to solve a common problem in sports:
      performance is often evaluated without visibility into preparation, discipline,
      recovery habits, or sustained engagement.
    </p>

    <p>
      XPGuess documents these signals in a standardized, reviewable way—without crossing
      medical, privacy, or regulatory boundaries.
    </p>

    <h2>What the Fitness Modules Include</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Structured training plans and routines</li>
      <li>Session-based activity and effort logging</li>
      <li>Recovery and rest engagement tracking</li>
      <li>Educational nutrition guidance (non-clinical)</li>
      <li>Participation-based wellness check-ins</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These tools record engagement and discipline—not health outcomes or diagnoses.
    </p>

    <h2>What XP Represents in Fitness Context</h2>

    <p>
      XP (Experience Points) function as a behavioral and participation ledger.
    </p>

    <p>
      XP may be earned for:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Completing training sessions</li>
      <li>Maintaining consistency over time</li>
      <li>Logging effort and recovery activities</li>
      <li>Engaging with educational content</li>
      <li>Participating in structured support workflows</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      XP does <strong>not</strong> represent medical improvement, injury recovery,
      mental health outcomes, or treatment effectiveness.
    </p>

    <h2>Support & Reflection (Therapy Mode)</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess includes a structured support and reflection layer often referred to as
      “Therapy Mode.” This is not clinical therapy.
    </p>

    <p>
      It provides:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Guided self-reflection prompts</li>
      <li>Well-being awareness check-ins</li>
      <li>Escalation signals to guardians or program staff</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If external support is needed, it occurs outside the platform.
      XPGuess does not store protected health information.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Matters for Athlete Evaluation</h2>

    <p>
      Coaches, agents, programs, and organizations often lack reliable signals beyond
      short-term performance metrics.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fitness and support framework provides objective indicators such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Training consistency</li>
      <li>Load management patterns</li>
      <li>Recovery engagement</li>
      <li>Response to structure and feedback</li>
      <li>Discipline over time</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These signals help reduce bias, speculation, and timing-based misjudgment.
    </p>

    <h2>Governance & Compliance Alignment</h2>

    <p>
      The framework is designed to operate safely across:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Youth development programs</li>
      <li>Professional pipelines</li>
      <li>Multi-sport environments</li>
      <li>International jurisdictions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      By separating development tracking from medical care, XPGuess supports
      transparency, auditability, and ethical athlete protection.
