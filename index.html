    <h1>The Football Transfer System</h1>

    <p>
      The football (soccer) transfer system is one of the most misunderstood structures in global sport.
      Unlike American leagues, football operates under international labor and registration rules that affect
      when, how, and where an athlete may move.
    </p>

    <p>
      XPGuess and <strong>Name the Game (NTG)</strong> exist to make this system understandable, transparent,
      and fair for athletes and families navigating it for the first time.
    </p>

    <h2>Educational Purpose (Not Gambling)</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess is an educational platform. It does not involve money, wagering, prizes, equity, or financial outcomes.
      This page exists to explain how football transfers work and why timing, documentation, and governance matter.
    </p>

    <p>
      XP (Experience Points) in XPGuess are used only to track learning progress, verified participation, and decision discipline.
      XP is not redeemable for cash and does not represent financial value.
    </p>

    <h2>Why the Transfer System Is Confusing</h2>

    <p>
      Confusion often arises because the transfer system combines:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed registration periods</li>
      <li>International labor rights</li>
      <li>Contract status (attached vs unattached)</li>
      <li>Club and federation rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Without proper context, athletes—especially unattached players—can be misrepresented,
      undervalued, or pressured into poor decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>The Two Transfer Windows</h2>

    <p>
      Most professional football leagues operate with <strong>two official transfer windows</strong> each year.
    </p>

    <h2>1) The Summer Transfer Window</h2>

    <p>
      This is the primary transfer period. It usually opens after the end of the competitive season
      and allows clubs to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Register new players</li>
      <li>Transfer players between clubs</li>
      <li>Sign unattached players</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Because most contracts expire in the summer, this window is the most active and strategic.
    </p>

    <h2>2) The January (Winter) Transfer Window</h2>

    <p>
      The January window is shorter and more tactical. It exists to allow clubs to address:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Injuries</li>
      <li>Unexpected performance gaps</li>
      <li>Roster imbalances mid-season</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Moves during this period are often reactive rather than developmental.
    </p>

    <h2>Unattached Players (Free Agents)</h2>

    <p>
      An unattached player is an athlete who is <strong>not currently under contract</strong> with a club.
      This status is frequently misunderstood and unfairly stigmatized.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being unattached does <strong>not</strong> mean:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lack of quality</li>
      <li>Lack of discipline</li>
      <li>Career failure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In many cases, it reflects timing, age eligibility, administrative gaps,
      or strategic career decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>Free Movement and “Free Trade” in Football</h2>

    <p>
      Football is governed by international labor law principles that allow
      <strong>free movement of workers</strong> once contractual obligations are fulfilled.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a contract expires, an athlete may:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Move freely between clubs</li>
      <li>Negotiate independently</li>
      <li>Choose leagues across borders</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is fundamentally different from draft-based or franchise-controlled systems.
      It gives athletes freedom—while also placing responsibility on them to manage their careers wisely.
    </p>

    <h2>Where Bias Can Appear</h2>

    <p>
      Bias often enters the system when:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>An athlete is unattached during a window</li>
      <li>There is no transparent performance record</li>
      <li>Decisions are based on rumor instead of documentation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is where governance and verified tracking matter.
    </p>

    <h2>How XP Reduces Transfer Bias</h2>

    <p>
      A common problem in football is that athletes—especially unattached players—are judged by status and timing
      rather than by verified training, decision discipline, and consistency.
    </p>

    <p>
      XPGuess exists to create a governed record of progress that helps reduce this bias.
      XP functions as a non-cash educational metric that makes it easier to evaluate an athlete using documented signals
      instead of rumor, sentiment, or window-based pressure.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Unattached does not mean unknown:</strong> XP-backed activity provides continuity when contracts change.</li>
      <li><strong>Window pressure is reduced:</strong> the athlete’s record exists before the window opens.</li>
      <li><strong>Decisions become reviewable:</strong> participation and decision scenarios create accountability.</li>
      <li><strong>Families gain clarity:</strong> the system explains what is happening and why, in plain language.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How NTG and XPGuess Govern the Process</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Name the Game (NTG)</strong> manages and monitors athlete development through the hosted XPGuess app core.
      The goal is to document progress and protect athletes from confusion, bias, and exploitative pressure—especially during transfer windows.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system can maintain a governed pathway record that includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Documented training participation and progression</li>
      <li>Decision intelligence via Yes / No scenarios tied to real-world outcomes</li>
      <li>Transparent XP milestones as learning proof (non-cash)</li>
      <li>Verified timelines that align with transfer and registration periods</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This creates continuity that follows the athlete whether they are attached, unattached, or moving freely.
    </p>

    <h2>From Confusion to Clarity</h2>

    <p>
      When a club, agent, or program evaluates an NTG athlete, they are not guessing based on timing or status.
    </p>

    <p>
      They are reviewing a governed profile backed by documented learning, decision-making, and progression—independent of transfer window noise.
    </p>
