    <p>
      XP on XPGuess represents participation, consistency, and learning within structured sports and development systems.
      It is not a financial reward, performance score, or prediction of future success.
    </p>

    <p>
      XP exists to document engagement with real-world rules, timelines, and decision-making processes that govern
      professional and developmental sports environments.
    </p>

    <h2>What XP Represents</h2>

    <p>
      XP functions as a standardized participation signal. It reflects how consistently a participant engages with
      educational content, governed processes, and structured learning activities.
    </p>

    <p>
      XP does not represent athletic ability, medical outcomes, or competitive ranking.
    </p>

    <h2>How XP Is Earned</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Participating in educational questions and learning prompts</li>
      <li>Engaging with verified sports governance scenarios</li>
      <li>Completing structured learning flows over time</li>
      <li>Maintaining consistency across learning sessions</li>
      <li>Participating in approved training or support modules (non-medical)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What XP Is Not</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>XP is not money or a financial instrument</li>
      <li>XP is not gambling or wagering</li>
      <li>XP does not predict career outcomes</li>
      <li>XP is not a medical or psychological metric</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This distinction allows XPGuess to operate safely across age groups, sports, and jurisdictions,
      while remaining aligned with educational and governance standards.
