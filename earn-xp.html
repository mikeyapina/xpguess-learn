    <h1>Earn XP on XPGuess</h1>

    <p>
      How XP (Experience Points) are earned, tracked, and used as an educational progress system — including Busking XP conversion.
    </p>

    <h2>Educational, Not Gambling</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess is an educational platform. It does not involve money, wagering, prizes, equity, or financial outcomes.
      XP is used only to track learning progress, participation, and verified activity inside the system.
    </p>

    <h2>What This Page Explains</h2>

    <p>
      This page explains how XP is earned in XPGuess using a transparent progress framework that makes it easy to understand
      what actions earn XP and what XP represents.
    </p>

    <p>
      XPGuess uses progress-style clarity similar to how other platforms present “ways to earn” and “status tiers,”
      but XPGuess does not offer investment credits, cash, carry, or financial rewards.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is XP in XPGuess?</h2>

    <p>
      XP (Experience Points) are a learning metric. They represent participation and progress in understanding how professional
      football (soccer) decisions work — especially transfers, governance, and official outcomes.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Educational progress</li>
      <li>Participation-based</li>
      <li>Non-cash</li>
      <li>Not redeemable</li>
      <li>Verified-topic learning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Important</h2>

    <p>
      XP is <strong>not money</strong>, not a currency, and not redeemable for cash. It is comparable to progress points in a training
      or learning program.
    </p>

    <h2>Ways to Earn XP</h2>

    <h2>1) Answering Verified Yes / No Questions</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess uses simple Yes / No questions to teach how real decisions in professional football resolve. Questions are designed around
      verified events and official outcomes — not rumor.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Questions are based on real-world football decision points.</li>
      <li>Resolutions reference official announcements (clubs, leagues, governing bodies).</li>
      <li>XP is awarded for participation and completion as part of learning progression.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2) Completing Learning Modules (when available)</h2>

    <p>
      Some XP is earned through structured educational content that explains how the system works.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Decision-making walkthroughs</li>
      <li>Transfer-market explainers</li>
      <li>Governance concepts (rules, compliance, official sources)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3) Busking XP Conversion (Verified Social Activity)</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess includes an optional pathway called Busking, designed for people who build real-world momentum through performance and social platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Busking mode, the system can convert verified platform signals (for example: engagement activity, followers, or verified reach)
      into XP for learning progression and system participation.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>This conversion is designed to mirror how social platforms recognize activity in their own ecosystems.</li>
      <li>XPGuess uses it as a non-cash educational credit to represent verified momentum and consistency.</li>
      <li>No cash, no payout promises, and no investment credits are provided by XPGuess for Busking XP.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where to Learn More</h2>

    <p>
      Busking has its own section inside the platform. Visit:
      <a href="https://learn.xpguess.com/busking">Busking System</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      If your Busking page lives on another domain/path, replace <strong>/busking</strong> with the correct link.
    </p>

    <h2>XP Status Levels (Learning Progress Only)</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess may display status tiers to help learners understand progress — similar to levels in training platforms.
      These tiers are not financial and do not provide monetary rewards.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Status tier:</strong> Starter — Beginning progress</li>
      <li><strong>Status tier:</strong> Active Learner — Consistent participation</li>
      <li><strong>Status tier:</strong> Advanced Learner — Deeper understanding</li>
      <li><strong>Status tier:</strong> Expert Track — Educational mastery path</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Tier names and thresholds may evolve over time, but their purpose remains the same: educational progress tracking.
    </p>

    <h2>What XP Does Not Do</h2>

    <p>
      To be explicit for crawlers, reviewers, and families:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>No cash rewards</li>
      <li>No wagering</li>
      <li>No prizes</li>
      <li>No investment credits</li>
      <li>No equity, carry, or financial upside</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      XPGuess does not follow referral-for-money, carry, equity, or credit models.
    </p>

    <h2>Why XPGuess Uses XP</h2>

    <p>
      XP exists to solve a real educational gap: many people interact with sports outcomes without understanding how decisions are actually made.
      XP helps learners track progress without introducing monetization pressure.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Encourages structured learning and consistency</li>
      <li>Tracks engagement over time</li>
      <li>Supports youth-safe, education-first participation</li>
      <li>Creates transparent milestones for coaches, parents, and learners</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who XPGuess Is For</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Students learning how football systems work</li>
      <li>Athletes understanding professional pathways</li>
      <li>Parents seeking safe sports education</li>
      <li>Coaches and educators explaining governance</li>
      <li>Fans who want clarity beyond rumors</li>
    </ul>
