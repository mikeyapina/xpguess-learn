    <h1>Earn XP on XPGuess</h1>

    <p>
      This page explains how XP (Experience Points) are earned inside XPGuess. XP is an educational progress metric used to
      track learning, participation, and verified activity across the platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>XPGuess is educational, not gambling.</strong> The platform does not involve real money, wagering, prizes, equity,
      investment credits, or financial outcomes. XP has no cash value.
    </p>

    <h2>What XP Means</h2>

    <p>
      XP (Experience Points) represent progress in understanding how real football (soccer) decisions work — including official outcomes,
      transfer markets, governance, and timing.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>XP is not money</strong> and is not redeemable for cash.</li>
      <li>XP is used to measure <strong>learning progress</strong> and <strong>system participation</strong>.</li>
      <li>XP supports transparent progress tracking for learners, families, and educators.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ways to Earn XP</h2>

    <h3>1) Answer Verified Yes / No Questions</h3>
    <p>
      The primary way to earn XP is by participating in XPGuess questions. Each question is a clear statement with two possible answers:
      <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>No</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Questions are written in advance and include a defined open window, close window, and resolution criteria. XPGuess questions focus on
      clarity and official outcomes — not speculation or rumors.
    </p>

    <h3>2) Learn From Official Outcomes</h3>
    <p>
      XPGuess questions are resolved using official public sources such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Club announcements</li>
      <li>League registrations</li>
      <li>Governing body confirmations</li>
      <li>Official regulatory decisions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      XPGuess does not use rumors, leaks, or unofficial reporting to resolve questions.
    </p>

    <h3>3) Complete Learning Modules (When Available)</h3>
    <p>
      Some XP can be earned through structured educational content, such as explainers and walkthroughs that teach how professional football systems function.
      Modules may include transfer-market education, governance basics, and decision-making training.
    </p>

    <h2>The Busking System (XP Conversion From Verified Social Activity)</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess also supports an optional pathway called <strong>Busking</strong>. Busking is designed for participants who build real momentum through public performance
      and social platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
      In Busking mode, XPGuess can convert <strong>verified social activity signals</strong> (for example: verified engagement activity, followers, or verified reach)
      into <strong>XP for system progress</strong>.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>This conversion is a <strong>non-cash educational credit</strong> used to recognize consistency and verified activity.</li>
      <li>It is designed to reflect how platforms recognize engagement inside their own ecosystems, without introducing cash rewards.</li>
      <li>XPGuess does <strong>not</strong> provide money, payouts, investment credits, equity, or financial rewards through Busking XP.</li>
    </ul>
