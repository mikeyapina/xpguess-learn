    <h1>Earn XP on XPGuess</h1>

    <p>
      This page explains how XP (Experience Points) are earned inside XPGuess.
      XP is used to track educational participation and learning progress.
    </p>

    <p>
      XPGuess uses XP to help people understand how real football (soccer) decisions work.
      The platform is educational and does not involve real money.
    </p>

    <h2>How XP Is Earned</h2>

    <p>
      XP is earned by participating in educational activities on the platform.
      The primary method is answering verified <strong>Yes or No</strong> questions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Questions may reference both the January (winter) transfer window and the summer transfer window,
      depending on when official decisions occur.
    </p>

    <h2>Question Format</h2>

    <p>
      Each XPGuess question presents a clear statement with two possible answers: Yes or No.
    </p>

    <p>
      Questions are written in advance and include a defined resolution date and criteria.
    </p>

    <h2>How XP Is Verified</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess questions are resolved using official public sources such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Club announcements</li>
      <li>League registrations</li>
      <li>Governing body confirmations</li>
      <li>Official regulatory decisions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      XPGuess does not use rumors, leaks, or unofficial reporting to resolve questions.
    </p>

    <h2>The Busking System</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess also supports a system called <strong>Busking</strong>.
      Busking allows verified social or performance activity to be converted into XP.
    </p>

    <p>
      This may include activity such as verified engagement or followers on external platforms.
      XP is awarded as educational progress only.
    </p>

    <p>
      Busking XP is not money and does not represent payments or payouts.
    </p>

    <h2>Educational Purpose</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess exists to support learning and understanding of football systems,
      including transfer windows, governance, and professional decision-making.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform is not gambling and does not involve real money.
