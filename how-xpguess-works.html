    <p>
      XPGuess is an educational sports learning platform built to explain how real-world professional sports systems work.
      It uses structured Yes-or-No questions that are resolved using verified outcomes and official rules — not rumors.
    </p>

    <p>
      XPGuess is not gambling. No real money is involved. XP is used only to track learning participation and consistency.
    </p>

    <h2>The Core Mechanism</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess presents clear questions about real sports decisions and outcomes — such as roster changes, eligibility,
      registration timing, and governance-driven events — across multiple sports environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each question is designed to help participants learn how professional systems operate under rules, timelines,
      and documentation requirements.
    </p>

    <h2>How Questions Are Resolved</h2>

    <p>
      Questions are resolved using verified outcomes, such as official announcements and rule-based confirmations.
      The goal is to teach how decisions are validated in real systems — and how false narratives spread when verification is missing.
    </p>

    <h2>What Participants Learn</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>How governance structures affect athlete movement and opportunity</li>
      <li>How timing windows, seasons, and registration periods constrain decisions</li>
      <li>How verified outcomes differ from rumor-driven narratives</li>
      <li>How to think clearly under uncertainty without speculation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What XP Represents</h2>

    <p>
      XP is a participation and learning ledger. It reflects engagement, consistency, and progress through educational content.
      XP does not represent money, performance ranking, or career outcome prediction.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

    <p>
      In many sports environments, decisions are influenced by incomplete records, bias, or timing pressure.
      XPGuess strengthens understanding by making governance and system logic visible — and by teaching how to evaluate claims
      using verified sources and structured reasoning.
