    <h1>How XPGuess Works</h1>

    <p>
      XPGuess is an educational platform designed to help people understand how real football decisions and events unfold over time.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform uses simple <strong>Yes or No</strong> questions to focus on clarity, timing, and official outcomes rather than speculation or rumors.
    </p>

    <h2>Question Format</h2>

    <p>
      Each XPGuess question presents a clear statement with two possible answers: Yes or No.
    </p>

    <p>
      Questions are written in advance and include a defined resolution date and criteria.
    </p>

    <h2>How Outcomes Are Resolved</h2>

    <p>
      Outcomes are resolved using official public sources such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Club announcements</li>
      <li>League registrations</li>
      <li>Governing body confirmations</li>
      <li>Official regulatory decisions</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      XPGuess does not use rumors, leaks, or unofficial reporting to resolve questions.
    </p>

    <h2>Educational Purpose</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess exists to support learning and understanding of football systems, including transfer windows, governance, and decision-making processes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform is not gambling and does not involve real money.
