    <h1 style="margin:0 0 12px 0; line-height:1.2;">Why Traditional Metrics Miss the Full Picture</h1>

    <p style="margin:0 0 14px 0; line-height:1.6;">
      Most athlete evaluation systems rely on surface-level indicators. Even when statistics are involved,
      they are often treated as isolated snapshots — a single match, a short window, a moment in time.
    </p>

    <p style="margin:0 0 18px 0; line-height:1.6;">
      These metrics may look objective, but without context they can tell an incomplete story. It’s like taking
      a single temperature reading and assuming you understand someone’s overall health.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:22px 0 10px 0; line-height:1.25;">The Problem Isn’t a Lack of Data</h2>

    <p style="margin:0 0 14px 0; line-height:1.6;">
      The real gap is context and continuity. Traditional systems rarely capture the decisions an athlete made,
      the conditions those decisions were made under, or how learning evolves over time.
    </p>

    <p style="margin:0 0 10px 0; line-height:1.6;">
      When the record is incomplete, evaluation becomes vulnerable to:
    </p>

    <ul style="margin:0 0 18px 18px; line-height:1.6;">
      <li>Bias and reputation effects</li>
      <li>Timing pressure and short-window judgments</li>
      <li>Rumor-driven narratives</li>
      <li>Overreaction to single outcomes</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="margin:22px 0 10px 0; line-height:1.25;">From Outcome Obsession to Process Intelligence</h2>

    <p style="margin:0 0 14px 0; line-height:1.6;">
      XPGuess is built on a different assumption: progress is not a single outcome. It is a governed process.
      Instead of relying only on final results, XP-based systems document signals over time — participation,
      decision scenarios, learning milestones, and verified timelines aligned with real-world cycles.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:22px 0 10px 0; line-height:1.25;">Why This Matters</h2>

    <p style="margin:0 0 14px 0; line-height:1.6;">
      When progress is documented over time, decisions can be reviewed rather than guessed, development can be
      evaluated without speculation, and athletes can be assessed on readiness — not timing noise.
    </p>

    <p style="margin:0 0 18px 0; line-height:1.6;">
      This does not eliminate natural selection or talent differences. It reduces blind spots that cause capable
      athletes to be overlooked or misjudged.
    </p>

    <h2 style="margin:22px 0 10px 0; line-height:1.25;">Objective Signals Replace Assumptions</h2>

    <p style="margin:0 0 18px 0; line-height:1.6;">
      By shifting from isolated stats to context-aware records, the system creates objectivity where subjectivity
      once dominated. What emerges is not hype or guarantees — but clarity.
