    <h1>The Busking System</h1>

    <p>
      Busking is an advanced XPGuess pathway that allows participants to convert <strong>verified real-world momentum</strong>
      into educational XP. It is designed for athletes and creators who are already performing publicly
      and want that effort to count inside a governed learning system.
    </p>

    <h2>What Busking Is (and Is Not)</h2>

    <p>
      Busking is <strong>not</strong> a payout system, not NIL compensation, and not a financial reward program.
      It is an educational credit mechanism that recognizes consistency, reach, and discipline.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>No cash payments</li>
      <li>No gambling</li>
      <li>No prizes or financial upside</li>
      <li>No equity or investment credits</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      XP earned through Busking is used only for learning progression, system participation,
      and demonstrating verified momentum.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Busking Exists</h2>

    <p>
      In modern sports and media, many young athletes generate real attention through performance,
      social platforms, or public engagement. However, raw visibility alone does not translate into
      opportunity, scholarships, or professional trust.
    </p>

    <p>
      Busking exists to solve that gap by turning unstructured attention into a
      <strong>governed signal</strong> that can be understood by parents, coaches, and decision-makers.
    </p>

    <h2>How Busking Works</h2>

    <p>
      The Busking system allows verified activity to be reviewed and converted into XP.
      Examples of signals may include:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Verified engagement or reach</li>
      <li>Consistent performance output</li>
      <li>Documented audience interaction</li>
      <li>Public participation tied to athletic or creative effort</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These signals are <strong>not valued as money</strong>. They are translated into XP as proof of
      discipline, consistency, and real-world execution.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Busking Matters at the Highest Level</h2>

    <p>
      At elite levels, performance is not judged only by raw skill. It is judged by:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Consistency over time</li>
      <li>Ability to handle pressure</li>
      <li>Decision discipline</li>
      <li>Governance and accountability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Busking allows athletes to demonstrate these traits before a scout, agent, or program
      ever takes a risk on them.
    </p>

    <h2>Busking and Decision Intelligence</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess is built around the idea that elite performance is driven by decision-making under pressure.
      Busking XP complements the Yes / No decision model by showing that an athlete can:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Commit to effort consistently</li>
      <li>Operate in public environments</li>
      <li>Manage attention without losing discipline</li>
      <li>Translate momentum into structured progress</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>From Visibility to Proof</h2>

    <p>
      Without governance, visibility is noise.
      With Busking, visibility becomes <strong>documented proof</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When an XPGuess participant presents their profile, Busking XP shows that
      their momentum is not accidental—it is earned, verified, and governed.
