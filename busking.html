    <h1 style="margin-top:0;">Busking & Informal Performance Paths</h1>

    <p>
      In many sports and performance economies, people develop skills and earn visibility outside formal pipelines.
      This includes informal training environments, street performance (“busking”), community competition, and
      self-organized showcases.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page is an educational overview of why informal paths matter — and why governance, documentation, and
      safety boundaries are critical when visibility emerges outside structured systems.
    </p>

    <h2>What “Busking” Means in a Development Context</h2>

    <p>
      “Busking” typically refers to performing in public spaces for voluntary support. In a broader talent and sports
      context, it can also describe informal, public-facing participation where a person builds real-world skill under
      observation — without formal affiliation, contracts, or institutional protection.
    </p>

    <p>
      Informal pathways are not inherently negative. They can reflect access barriers, economic realities, or simply the
      fact that opportunity often appears before formal recognition.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Informal Paths Are High-Impact — and High-Risk</h2>

    <p>
      Informal environments can create rapid visibility, but they often lack:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Clear governance rules</li>
      <li>Reliable documentation of progression</li>
      <li>Safety and consent guardrails (especially for minors)</li>
      <li>Fair attribution for work that becomes widely shared</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Without structure, capable participants can be overlooked, misrepresented, or extracted from without fair credit.
      The issue is rarely talent — the issue is an absence of verified continuity.
    </p>

    <h2>What XPGuess Adds (Educational, Non-Cash)</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess is designed to support governance-first learning and documentation.
      XP (Experience Points) is an educational metric that tracks participation, consistency, and decision discipline.
      XP is not money, not redeemable, and not tied to wagering.
    </p>

    <p>
      In informal pathways, documentation matters because it creates continuity that does not rely on rumor,
      timing pressure, or status-based assumptions.
    </p>

    <h2>Why This Matters Across Sports and Performance Domains</h2>

    <p>
      Informal development exists in many categories:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Street and community football (soccer), pickup circuits, and informal leagues</li>
      <li>Independent training groups and self-run showcases</li>
      <li>Music, comedy, voice, and performance communities outside institutions</li>
      <li>Regional or cross-border talent ecosystems where access is uneven</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      When progress is documented and explained in a governed way, decision-making becomes reviewable rather than
      speculative — and participants are less vulnerable to exploitation or mislabeling.
    </p>

    <h2>Compliance & Safety Boundary</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess is an educational platform. It does not broker deals, act as an agent, or provide financial incentives.
      This page is informational and exists to explain how informal pathways intersect with governance and athlete/talent protection.
