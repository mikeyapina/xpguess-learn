    <h1 style="margin-top:0;">The Football Transfer System</h1>

    <p>
      The football (soccer) transfer system is one of the most misunderstood structures in global sport.
      Unlike draft-based leagues, football operates under international labor, registration,
      and contract rules that affect when and how an athlete may move.
    </p>

    <p>
      This page exists to explain the system clearly — without hype — so athletes, families,
      and programs understand what is happening and why timing matters.
    </p>

    <h2>Educational Purpose (Not Gambling)</h2>

    <p>
      XPGuess is an educational platform. It does not involve money, wagering, prizes, equity,
      or financial outcomes. XP is used only to track learning progress and participation.
    </p>

    <h2>Why the Transfer System Is Often Confusing</h2>

    <p>
      Confusion arises because the system combines multiple layers at once:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed registration periods</li>
      <li>Contract status (attached vs unattached)</li>
      <li>Domestic and international federation rules</li>
      <li>Labor and eligibility law</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Without context, athletes — especially unattached players —
      can be misrepresented or judged unfairly.
    </p>

    <h2>The Two Primary Transfer Windows</h2>

    <h3>1) The Summer Transfer Window</h3>

    <p>
      This is the primary transfer period in most leagues.
      It typically opens after the season ends and allows clubs to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Register new players</li>
      <li>Transfer players between clubs</li>
      <li>Sign unattached players</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Because many contracts expire in summer, this window is the most active.
    </p>

    <h3>2) The January (Winter) Transfer Window</h3>

    <p>
      The January window is shorter and more tactical.
      It exists to address:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Injuries</li>
      <li>Unexpected roster gaps</li>
      <li>Mid-season adjustments</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Decisions during this window are often reactive rather than developmental.
