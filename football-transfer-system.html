    <h1>The Football Transfer System</h1>

    <p>
      The football (soccer) transfer system is one of the most misunderstood structures in global sport.
      Unlike American leagues, football operates under international labor and registration rules
      that affect when, how, and where an athlete may move.
    </p>

    <p>
      XPGuess and <strong>Name the Game (NTG)</strong> exist to make this system understandable, transparent,
      and fair for athletes and families navigating it for the first time.
    </p>

    <h2>Why the Transfer System Is Confusing</h2>

    <p>
      Confusion often arises because the transfer system combines:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Fixed registration periods</li>
      <li>International labor rights</li>
      <li>Contract status (attached vs unattached)</li>
      <li>Club and federation rules</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Without proper context, athletes—especially unattached players—can be misrepresented,
      undervalued, or pressured into poor decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>The Two Transfer Windows</h2>

    <p>
      Most professional football leagues operate with <strong>two official transfer windows</strong> each year.
    </p>

    <h2>1) The Summer Transfer Window</h2>

    <p>
      This is the primary transfer period. It usually opens after the end of the competitive season
      and allows clubs to:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Register new players</li>
      <li>Transfer players between clubs</li>
      <li>Sign unattached players</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Because most contracts expire in the summer, this window is the most active and strategic.
    </p>

    <h2>2) The January (Winter) Transfer Window</h2>

    <p>
      The January window is shorter and more tactical. It exists to allow clubs to address:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Injuries</li>
      <li>Unexpected performance gaps</li>
      <li>Roster imbalances mid-season</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Moves during this period are often reactive rather than developmental.
    </p>

    <h2>Unattached Players (Free Agents)</h2>

    <p>
      An unattached player is an athlete who is <strong>not currently under contract</strong> with a club.
      This status is frequently misunderstood and unfairly stigmatized.
    </p>

    <p>
      Being unattached does <strong>not</strong> mean:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Lack of quality</li>
      <li>Lack of discipline</li>
      <li>Career failure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In many cases, it reflects timing, age eligibility, administrative gaps,
      or strategic career decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>Free Movement and “Free Trade” in Football</h2>

    <p>
      Football is governed by international labor law principles that allow
      <strong>free movement of workers</strong> once contractual obligations are fulfilled.
    </p>

    <p>
      When a contract expires, an athlete may:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Move freely between clubs</li>
      <li>Negotiate independently</li>
      <li>Choose leagues across borders</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is fundamentally different from draft-based or franchise-controlled systems.
      It gives athletes freedom—but also places responsibility on them to manage their careers wisely.
    </p>

    <h2>Where Bias Can Appear</h2>

    <p>
      Bias often enters the system when:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>An athlete is unattached during a window</li>
      <li>There is no transparent performance record</li>
      <li>Decisions are based on rumor instead of documentation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is where governance and verified tracking matter.
    </p>

    <h2>How NTG and XPGuess Govern the Process</h2>

    <p>
      <strong>Name the Game (NTG)</strong> manages and monitors athlete development and decision-making
      through the XPGuess app core.
    </p>

    <p>
      The system provides:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Documented training and participation history</li>
      <li>Decision intelligence through Yes / No scenarios</li>
      <li>Governed XP progression</li>
      <li>Verified timelines that align with transfer windows</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This creates a transparent ledger that follows the athlete—whether they are attached,
      unattached, or moving freely.
    </p>

    <h2>From Confusion to Clarity</h2>

    <p>
      When a club, agent, or program evaluates an NTG athlete,
      they are not guessing based on timing or status.
    </p>

    <p>
      They are reviewing a governed profile backed by documented learning,
      decision-making, and progression—independent of transfer window noise.
